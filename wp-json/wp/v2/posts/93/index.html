Tomlin, who has never had a losing season in his 16 years as coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers, talked about the people who had helped him along the way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Smith, former NFL head coach of the Chicago Bears and Houston Texans, spent a year in Lexington on Bill Curry\u2019s 1992 staff. In his video, Smith displayed a Kentucky football helmet and a game ball from the Cats\u2019 37-25 win over Indiana in 1992.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the inductions, Tomlin reappeared on video to tell former Steelers defensive back Mike Mitchell, \u201cI had the pleasure of watching you work.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mitchell was one of five inductees in this year\u2019s class, all with their own stories to tell.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Former Washington Redskins offensive line coach Joe Bugel (who played at Western Kentucky) and former Los Angeles Rams defensive lineman Frank Fuller (who played at UK) were inducted posthumously. Fuller died in 1993. Bugel died in 2020.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inductee Teddy Bridgewater, the former star Louisville quarterback who has played eight years in the NFL, was not at Friday night\u2019s dinner.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve Wright, the former Green Bay Packers offensive tackle who played his high school football at Louisville Manual, was in attendance despite recently undergoing back surgery. The 80-year-old Wright played for Bear Bryant at Alabama and Vince Lombardi of the Green Bay Packers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThere wasn\u2019t a whole lot of difference between the two,\u201d said Wright, who now lives in Augusta, Ga. \u201cThey taught you to not only play for your team, but to play for yourself.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wright\u2019s likeness \u2014 a lineman standing on the sideline with the familiar weather coat hanging from his shoulder pads \u2014 was also the model for the Walter Payton Man Award presented each year by the NFL.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fellow inductee Larry Kirksey also had an Alabama connection. The former Harlan High School and Eastern Kentucky star was the running backs coach on Gene Stallings\u2019 1992 national title team. Among his previous stops, Kirksey served as an assistant coach on Fran Curci\u2019s 10-1 Kentucky team in 1977.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kirksey is still coaching. He is on the staff of the USFL\u2019s Birmingham Stallions. And he won a Super Bowl ring in 1994 as wide receivers coach of the San Francisco 49ers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, star pupil Jerry Rice appeared on video Friday to thank Kirksey for his coaching and congratulate him on his induction. \u201cYou are the GOAT,\u201d Rice said. \u201cYou\u2019re the champion. I love you.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last but not least was Mitchell, who played high school football at both Covington Catholic and Fort Thomas Highlands before starring at Ohio University. Uninvited to the NFL combine, Mitchell was still a second-round draft pick by the Oakland Raiders in 2009. After joining the Steelers in 2013, Mitchell\u2019s star began to shine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThat was a little awkward,\u201d the 36-year-old Mitchell said after an introduction video that featured many of his hits and celebrations with Pittsburgh. \u201cMy girlfriend is here and I don\u2019t think she\u2019s seen that side of me.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now an assistant coach with the Indianapolis Colts, Mitchell also talked about achieving a goal against all odds, something that surely hit home with his new fraternity members.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Said Mitchell: \u201cI hope everybody here can experience that feeling of going for something.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Profile Image of John Clay<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>John Clay is a sports columnist for the Lexington Herald-Leader.
